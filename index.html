              I am an analyst at Eastman Chemical Company who focuses on
              supporting analytics for the Supply Chain portion of the business.
              I've been working around supply chain for 6 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my spare time, I enjoy learning about different things. My
              current project is a Master's Degree in Computer Science from
              Georgia Tech University. My focus is Interactive Intelligence, so
              I get to learn about many different kinds of artificial
              intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Programming plays a big part of my hobbies. When I find the time,
              I enjoy playing around with AI inside Unity. I also enjoy
              programming procedural generation centered around text and
              language generation.
